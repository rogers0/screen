Debian 1.1 uses ncurses/terminfo, not curses/termcap, so you really
shouldn't need the screencap file in this directory, nor a /etc/termcap
file.

The screeninfo.src file has been installed with the postinst of
screen, so you don't need to do it manually -- it's here for
reference, and to recover from stupid errors (like?).
