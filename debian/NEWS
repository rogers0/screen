screen (4.1.0~20120320gitdb59704-10) unstable; urgency=low

  A systemd variant of /etc/init.d/screen-cleanup has been added. This
  means that some of the optional functionality of this init script is
  lost on systems running systemd.

  On systems running systemd the permissions of /var/run/screen are no
  more updated automatically if the local administrator changes the
  permissions of /usr/bin/screen with dpkg-statoverride. Instead he has
  to copy /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/screen-cleanup.conf to /etc/tmpfiles.d/ and
  override the permissions in there.

screen (4.1.0~20120320gitdb59704-7) unstable; urgency=low

  In case you upgrade screen from 4.0.3 to 4.1.0 while running inside
  screen and you have to reconnect to that screen session (or any other
  screen session which has been started before the upgrade), there may be
  a few screen features not working until you exit the 4.0.3-started
  session and replace it with a 4.1.0-started session.

  Known issues of 4.0.3 to 4.1.0 interoperability as of now:

  * Terminal window resizing (WINCH signal) does not propagate to the
    screen session. Detach and reattach again instead to get the size of
    the terminals inside the screen session adjusted propely.
