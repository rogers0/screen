screen (4.1.0~20120320gitdb59704-7) unstable; urgency=low

  In case you upgrade screen from 4.0.3 to 4.1.0 while running inside
  screen and you have to reconnect to that screen session (or any other
  screen session which has been started before the upgrade), there may be
  a few screen features not working until you exit the 4.0.3-started
  session and replace it with a 4.1.0-started session.

  Known issues of 4.0.3 to 4.1.0 interoperability as of now:

  * Terminal window resizing (WINCH signal) does not propagate to the
    screen session. Detach and reattach again instead to get the size of
    the terminals inside the screen session adjusted propely.
