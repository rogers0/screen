This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of screen, a screen
manager with VT100/ANSI terminal emulation.

This package was put together from sources obtained from:
  ftp://ftp.gnu.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/screen-3.7.4.tar.gz

Changes for Debian:
  * added Debian GNU/Linux package maintenance system files
  * ETCSCREENRC definition changed to "/etc/screenrc" in config.h.in
  * 3.7.1-5--3.7.1-7 had "Depends: login (>=1.0-5) | shadow-login"
    because of a bug in the utmp handling in screen. This bug
    has been fixed by the upstream maintainer, and it should now
    not anymore need login-1.0-5 (or higer).
  * Used /var/run/screens instead of /tmp/screens
