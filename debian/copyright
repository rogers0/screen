This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of screen, a screen
manager with VT100/ANSI terminal emulation.  screen was originally
written by Oliver Laumann; the most recent version was produced by
Wayne Davison, Juergen Weigert and Michael Schroeder.

This package was put together by Ian Murdock <imurdock@debian.org>,
from sources obtained from:
 prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu/screen-3.6.2.tar.gz

Later taken over by joost witteveen <joostje@master.debian.org>,
who only added minor changes.

Changes:
 * added Debian GNU/Linux package maintenance system files
 * ETCSCREENRC definition changed to "/etc/screenrc" in config.h.in
 * remove /tmp/screens after installation and removal, as this prevents
   permission conflicts between different screen versions.
 * 3.7.1-5--3.7.1-7 had "Depends: login (>=1.0-5) | shadow-login"
   because of a bug in the utmp handling in screen. This bug
   has been fixed by the upstream maintainer, and it should now
   not anymore need login-1.0-5 (or higer).
