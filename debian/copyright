This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of screen, a screen
manager with VT100/ANSI terminal emulation.

This package was put together from sources obtained from:
  ftp://ftp.uni-erlangen.de/pub/utilities/screen/screen-3.9.5.tar.gz

Changes for Debian:
  * added Debian GNU/Linux package maintenance system files
  * ETCSCREENRC definition changed to "/etc/screenrc" in config.h.in
  * Used /var/run/screen instead of /tmp/screens
  * Added support for MD5-based passwords
  * Added PAM support
  * Make it set-gid "utmp" instead of setuid root
