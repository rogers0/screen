Description: A screen manager with VT100/ANSI terminal emulation.
 screen is a terminal multiplexor that runs several separate "screens"
 on a single physical character-based terminal.  Each virtual terminal
 emulates a DEC VT100 plus several ANSI X3.64 and ISO 2022 functions.
 Arbitrary keyboard input translation is also available.  Sessions can
 be detached and resumed later on a different terminal.
