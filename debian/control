Description: a terminal multiplexor with VT100/ANSI terminal emulation
 screen is a terminal multiplexor that runs several separate "screens" on a
 single physical character-based terminal.  Each virtual terminal emulates a
 DEC VT100 plus several ANSI X3.64 and ISO 2022 functions.  Screen sessions
 can be detached and resumed later on a different terminal.
 .
 Screen also supports a whole slew of other features.  Some of these are:
 configurable input and output translation, serial port support, configurable
 logging, multi-user support, and utf8 charset support.
