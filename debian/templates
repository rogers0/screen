_Description: Previous screen binary has been copied to /tmp/screen-4.0.3
 GNU Screen 4.1.0 currently can't speak with GNU Screen sessions
 started by GNU Screen 4.0.3.
 .
 On this system there seems to be at least one GNU Screen session
 running, possibly the one you run this upgrade in.
 .
 To be able to reconnect to your running GNU Screen session after the
 new screen package has been unpacked, you'll need to call the old
 screen binary instead of the new one. For that purpose, the old
 screen binary has been copied to /tmp/screen-4.0.3. You can call it
 like this: "/tmp/screen-4.0.3 -rd"
 .
 In case your /tmp/ is a separate mount point and mounted with the
 nosuid or noexec options, you may need to copy it to some other place
 beforehand, e.g. to /root/, before calling it. It's permissions
 should be 2755 (-rwxr-sr-x) and it should belong to the user root and
 group utmp.
