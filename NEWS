                   What's new in screen-3.7 ?
                  ----------------------------

* Color support. Screen understands the following capabilities:
      AF (setaf) = Set foreground color (ANSI compatible)
      AB (setab) = Set background color (ANSI compatible)
      AX         = Does understand ANSI set default fg/bg color
                   (\E[39m / \E[49m)
    The tweaks for the color xterm would be:
      termcap  xterm 'AF=\E[3%dm:AB=\E[4%dm'
      terminfo xterm 'AF=\E[3%p1%dm:AB=\E[4%p1%dm'
  Caution: Screen exposes a bug in X11R6 color xterm. Either use the
  patch ftp.uni-erlangen.de:pub/utilities/screen/color_xterm_patch
  or a clean rewrite of xterm: rxvt.

* Resize code completely rewritten. Long lines now get rewrapped,
  no information gets lost when a window is narrowed and widened. This
  affects both the visible window and its scrollback buffer. It is a
  big improvement for the latter. In previous versions the scrollback
  buffer was clipped when the window narrowed and padded with
  whitespace when it widened. 

* Input handling changed. The command key can now be a prefix
  of a function key sequence (hello wyse users :) )

* An empty argument to the escape command is allowed to disable
  command key processing. This is only allowed if some key
  is bound to the "command" command. This example makes F1 the
  new command key and allows the previous command key (usually ^A)
  to be typed directly:
      bindkey -k k1 command
      escape ""

* New 'digraph' command (bound to ^A^V)
  ^A^Va" or ^A^V0344 input an a-umlaut
  This helps if you want to work in an ISO-latin1 environment but your
  terminal's keyboard lacks a some of the more special characters.

* activity/bell message strings can now include the window title
  and the current date/time:
    %t - title
    %n - number (a single % still works)
    %d - day
    %D - weekday name
    %m - month
    %M - month name
    %y - year (2 digit)
    %Y - year (4 digit)
    %w - hour:minutes (24h format)
    %W - hour:minutes (12h format)
    %s - seconds
    %a - am/pm
    %A - AM/PM
  Please do not use a single '%' character for window titles any more.
  It is obsoleted by '%n' and will vanish in future releases.

* 'defhstatus' command to give every window a default
   hardstatus line. '^E' is used as a string escape instead of '%'.
   All the above substitution codes apply, but you must use ^E (octal
   005) here, as '%' is likely to appear in automaticaly generated
   hardstatus lines. Try 'defhstatus "Screen: window ^E (^Et)"'.

* In screenrc files and colon command mode: Input parser changed to
  also understand caret notation ('^') to mean "Control-" (as in
  the ^E example above).

* "logdir" command changed to "logfile". You can now specify the
   filename instead of the directory. The same directives as
   understood by the activity/bell messages can be used.
   The default is "screenlog.%n".

* Special terminfo workaround make delay processing work for
  the first time! If you had trouble with padding, then try again.

* New incomprehensible capability XC added to specify character
  translation depending on the terminal type. See the manual for
  more details and examples.
